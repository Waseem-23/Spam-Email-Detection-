# Spam-Email-Detection-
ðŸš€ Just Built My Second SMS Spam Detection Model using Machine Learning!
 (Yes, with raw Python, no shortcuts!)
After diving deep into the world of text classification, I finally built a machine learning model that can accurately detect whether an SMS message is spam or not spam ðŸ“²ðŸ§ .

Hereâ€™s what I covered in this video:
 âœ… Cleaning the dataset (handling punctuation, stopwords, lowercase)
 âœ… Feature extraction using CountVectorizer
 âœ… Model training using Multinomial Naive Bayes
 âœ… Accuracy testing and saving the model using pickle
 âœ… Struggled a LOT with text preprocessing and making the model generalize well!
ðŸ’¡ My Learning Curve:
Understanding how spam detection really works under the hood
Training a model from scratch and tweaking it until I got good accuracy
Dealing with errors like mismatched vector shapes, pickle serialization issues, and label handling
And honestly... staying motivated when the accuracy just wouldn't budge ðŸ˜…
ðŸ“‚ Shared the full source code in the video â€” no secrets, just pure effort.
 If youâ€™re curious about text-based ML models or want to build one yourself, this video might be your spark ðŸ’¥
